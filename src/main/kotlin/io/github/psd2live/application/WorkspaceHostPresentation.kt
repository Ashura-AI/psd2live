/**
 * What a [WorkspaceHost] reads of the workspace's presentation and what it tells it, for one kind of host: the desktop
 * editor shows the workspace in Compose state, the headless host shows nothing. [V] is the host's snapshot of its
 * presentation, captured when an operation starts and handed back with each notification so the host can tell
 * whether the presentation moved on meanwhile.
 *
 * The runtime's document is the only authority. A presentation shows it and may hold field drafts over it - edits
 * the editor has not committed yet, which it submits through the host's draft queue; the host shows each commit to
 * it before the commit lands ([show]), and the presentation carries its drafts over that commit.
